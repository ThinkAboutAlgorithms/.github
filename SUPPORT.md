# Support

Thank you for your interest in **Think About Algorithms** ❤️  
We’re truly glad you’re here and appreciate your participation in this educational open-source initiative.

This document explains how you can seek help, ask questions, report issues, request new algorithms, or contact the maintainers. Our goal is to provide clear guidance so that every contributor and learner knows exactly where to go for support and how to engage with the community effectively.

# About Think About Algorithms

Think About Algorithms is an educational, community-driven open-source project dedicated to providing clear, consistent, and high-quality implementations of core algorithms across multiple programming languages. The initiative emphasizes readability, conceptual understanding, and structured learning, making algorithms accessible to beginners while remaining useful to experienced developers.

The project is maintained by volunteers and contributors from around the world who share a common mission: to improve algorithm education through open collaboration and well-documented implementations. As a community project, its growth and quality depend on thoughtful participation, constructive feedback, and shared learning.

# Questions and Learning Help

If you have questions about how an algorithm works, how an implementation is structured, why a particular approach was chosen, how complexity is derived, or how to use or adapt the provided code, the best place to ask is the GitHub Discussions section.

Discussions are intended for learning-oriented conversations, conceptual clarification, and general help. They allow community members and maintainers to provide explanations that benefit not only the original questioner but also future learners who encounter the same topic. By asking in Discussions rather than Issues, you help keep the project organized while contributing to a shared knowledge base.

Before starting a new discussion, you may wish to search existing threads, as many common questions and explanations may already be available.

# Bug Reports

If you encounter incorrect algorithm behavior, wrong outputs, unhandled edge cases, documentation inaccuracies, or broken examples, you should open a GitHub Issue in the relevant repository. Issues are the appropriate channel for reporting defects or errors that require correction in the project’s content or code.

Clear and complete bug reports significantly improve resolution speed and accuracy. When reporting a problem, please include the algorithm name, programming language, input used, expected output, actual output, and any relevant environment details. Providing this information allows maintainers and contributors to reproduce and diagnose the issue efficiently.

Thoughtful bug reports are an important contribution to the project’s reliability and educational value.

# Algorithm Requests

If you would like to see a new algorithm added to the project, you are encouraged to submit a request. Requests may include missing algorithms, implementations in additional programming languages, optimized variants, or alternative forms such as iterative versus recursive approaches.

Algorithm requests should be submitted as GitHub Issues using the Algorithm Request template. This ensures consistency and helps maintainers track interest and prioritize additions. Before creating a request, please check existing issues to avoid duplication, as your requested algorithm may already be planned or under discussion.

Community requests play a central role in shaping the scope and direction of Think About Algorithms.

# Documentation and Resources

Before asking for help or clarification, contributors and learners are encouraged to review the available documentation and learning materials within the repositories. These include README files, algorithm explanations, inline code comments, and provided examples.

Many common questions regarding usage, behavior, and design decisions are already addressed in these resources. Consulting them first often provides immediate answers and helps maintain Discussions and Issues for topics that genuinely require further clarification or improvement.

Maintaining clear documentation is a core principle of the project, and users are welcome to suggest improvements if anything is unclear or incomplete.

# Contributing Help

If you are interested in contributing but need guidance regarding repository structure, naming conventions, implementation standards, formatting expectations, or testing requirements, please consult the CONTRIBUTING guide. This document explains the project’s conventions and workflow in detail and serves as the primary reference for contributors.

If any part of the contributing process remains unclear after reviewing the guide, you are welcome to open a GitHub Discussion for clarification. The community and maintainers are happy to help contributors align their work with project standards and succeed in their contributions.

Supporting new contributors is essential to sustaining a healthy open-source ecosystem.

# Security Issues

If you discover a potential security-related issue within the project, please do not report it publicly through Issues or Discussions. Public disclosure may expose users to unnecessary risk before a fix can be prepared and released.

Instead, follow the private reporting process described in the SECURITY guide. This ensures that maintainers can assess and address the issue responsibly and coordinate any necessary disclosures or updates.

Responsible reporting helps protect both the project and its users.

---

# Response Expectations

Think About Algorithms is a volunteer-maintained project, and all maintainers and contributors participate alongside their professional, academic, and personal commitments. While every effort is made to respond in a timely manner, response times may vary depending on availability and complexity.

In general, Discussions and Issues typically receive responses within a few days, while more complex topics or substantial requests may take longer. Your patience and understanding are sincerely appreciated, as community-driven projects depend on sustainable participation rather than immediate support cycles.

Respectful engagement and reasonable expectations help maintain a positive and productive environment for everyone.

# Scope of Support

Think About Algorithms focuses on educational explanations, conceptual guidance, and project-related clarifications. While the community is happy to explain algorithm concepts and discuss implementation approaches, the project does not provide certain forms of support.

This includes completing homework assignments, solving academic tasks on behalf of learners, providing competitive programming answers, offering private tutoring, or delivering urgent one-to-one debugging services. These boundaries ensure that the project remains an educational resource rather than a solution service.

However, contributors and learners are always welcome to ask conceptual questions and seek understanding, and the community will gladly provide guidance and explanations to support learning.

# Contact

For private matters, organizational inquiries, partnerships, or official maintainer contact information, please refer to the Think About Algorithms organization homepage. Contact details and official communication channels are maintained centrally there to ensure accuracy and prevent outdated or inconsistent information.

Centralized contact information helps maintain clarity, reliability, and professionalism in project communications.

---

# Community Values

Think About Algorithms is committed to fostering a respectful, welcoming, beginner-friendly, and collaborative environment. The project values constructive discussion, inclusive learning, and mutual support among contributors and learners of all experience levels.

All participants are expected to follow the Code of Conduct, which defines standards for respectful interaction and community behavior. Upholding these values ensures that the project remains a positive and accessible space for everyone interested in algorithms and programming education.
