# Security Policy

At **Think About Algorithms**, we take security concerns seriously. This policy explains how to report vulnerabilities and how we handle security-related disclosures.

## 🛡 Supported Projects

This security policy applies to all repositories under the **Think About Algorithms** organization unless a repository defines its own `SECURITY.md`.

Our repositories primarily contain educational implementations of algorithms across multiple programming languages. While these projects are not production services, we still take security-related concerns seriously.

---

## 🔎 What to Report

Please report:

- Security vulnerabilities in algorithm implementations
- Logic flaws that may cause unsafe behavior
- Dependency vulnerabilities (if applicable)
- Malicious code injections
- Unsafe use of language features (e.g., buffer overflows, unsafe memory handling, etc.)
- Any issue that could negatively impact users cloning or using the repository

If you are unsure whether something qualifies as a security issue, report it anyway.

---

## 🚫 What Not to Report

The following are generally **not** considered security vulnerabilities:

- Incorrect algorithm outputs (unless exploitable)
- Performance issues
- Style or formatting problems
- Feature requests
- Educational improvements

These should be opened as regular issues instead.

## 📩 How to Report a Vulnerability

Please **do not open a public issue** for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. Open a **private security advisory** via GitHub (if enabled), or  
2. Contact the maintainers directly via the organization contact email (if provided), or  
3. If no private channel is available, clearly mark the issue title with:  
   `SECURITY: <short description>`  

Include the following details:

- Repository name  
- A clear description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Proof of concept (if applicable)  
- Potential impact  
- Suggested fix (optional but appreciated)

Providing detailed information helps us resolve issues faster.

---

## ⏱ Response Timeline

We aim to:

- Acknowledge the report within **72 hours**
- Provide an update within **7 days**
- Release a fix as soon as reasonably possible

Response times may vary depending on complexity and maintainer availability.

---

## 🔐 Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before it is resolved
- Allow us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond proof-of-concept testing

We appreciate responsible disclosure and ethical reporting.

---

## 🙌 Recognition

Contributors who responsibly disclose valid security issues may be acknowledged in release notes or documentation (unless anonymity is requested).

---

## 📌 Scope

This policy applies only to repositories owned by the **Think About Algorithms** organization.

It does not apply to third-party forks, external dependencies, or unofficial mirrors.

---

Security and trust are important—even in educational repositories.

Thank you for helping us maintain a safe and professional open-source environment.
